# Praxis Client Generator

This project takes Praxis JSON api doc output and transforms it into source code
that implements a client for that particular API.

**NB: This is currently a work in progress and is not usable. Yet.**

The idea is to use Dependency Injection so that any output language/framework/libraby
can be supported. Initially this will be targeted for AngularJS and then will be
generalized.
